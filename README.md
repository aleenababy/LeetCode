# LeetCode Solutions Repository

## Overview

Welcome to my LeetCode Solutions Repository! This repository contains my solutions to various problems on LeetCode. I have organized the solutions by shortening the problem, making navigating and finding specific solutions easy.

## Structure

- Each folder is named according to the problem number.
- Inside each folder, you'll find:
  - The solution file (e.g., `solution.py`).
  - If applicable, additional files related to the problem (e.g., input/output examples).

## Usage

Feel free to explore the solutions for reference or inspiration. If you have suggestions for improvements or alternative solutions, please don't hesitate to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Contributing

If you'd like to contribute by adding your solutions or improving existing ones, follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch for your changes: `git checkout -b feature/new-solution`.
3. Add your solution in the corresponding problem folder.
4. Ensure your code follows best practices and includes comments where necessary.
5. Test your solution with different cases if applicable.
6. Commit your changes: `git commit -m "Add solution to Problem X"`.
7. Push to the branch: `git push origin feature/new-solution`.
8. Open a pull request.

## Disclaimer

These solutions are intended for learning and reference purposes. While I strive to provide accurate and efficient solutions, there may be multiple ways to solve a problem, and solutions may vary in complexity and style. Always aim to understand the underlying concepts and principles behind each solution.

Happy coding!
